## Timetable
See [TODO.md](https://github.com/afischer/vynl/blob/master/TODO.md) for a complete timeline and goal completion deadlines.

## Workflow
*Since we're in the dev stage, our master is our dev branch.*

1. Branch from `master`/another dev branch (use style <yourname>/<branchdiscription>)
2. Make your changes. Commit a lot. Be descriptive.
3. Push your changes to your new branch.
4. When finished, prepare to merge back into master.
    1. If you have made a lot of changes, consider doing a `git rebase` from master to avoid conflics
    2. If changes can be easily merged, make a PR from github.
5. Let someone else know you're merging to `master`. Get the okay.
6. Merge to master.
7. Make sure everything is okay and working properly. After a few hours/days, delete the stale branch.
