Have you:
1. Cleared your cache?
2. Thoroughly tested your code?
3. Pushed to a seperate branch and had someone else check your code?

Make sure to:
1. Pull using the script on the server
2. Clear the cache again
3. If there are a lot of conflicts, personally back up the working code in case of trouble
